And it's done. Our Network site is no longer a simple HTML/CSS/JS site, but instead a more powerful site powered by [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus). 
It was a surprisingly quick change. Less than three hours total, with a lot of the time being dedicated to figuring out how to set this thing up.
Moving over the old stuff didn't take too long either, since most of it wasn't anything fancy. In under two and a half hours, I had everything but this blog post written.

And in a total of with deploying and this blog post it's going to be a 3 hour journey. Hope to have most content for you guys to read here soon!
