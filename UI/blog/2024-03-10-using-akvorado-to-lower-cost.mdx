[Akvorado](https://github.com/akvorado/akvorado) is a very powerful tool in network engineer's toolbox. 
We use it at Ryamer to help us identify how traffic comes into and our of our network and optomize that by seeing if we could shift any of that traffic over to the [IX](docs/Peering/IX) that we are part of.
But today I'm not here to talk about how we've reduced costs at Ryamer, but instead on another larger network, who we are going to call X(not the one formerly known as Twitter) for now.
