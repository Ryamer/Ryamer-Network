# Peering With Ryamer

We maintain an mostly open peering policy. If you want to peer with us, we will peer with you. To get started, please send an email to peering@ryamer.com and include your ASN, and where you want to peer and how.

* Our ASN is 400587 and that is used everywhere.

* We generally peer with route servers and prefer that you do too. Bilateral sessions are preferred with network that we exchange higher amounts of traffic with.

* BGP MD5 is not required but can use it if necessary.

* For private peering, we require a minimum of 10gbps connection and must be exchanging at least 500mbps of traffic measured at the 95th% over a span of 1 week.

* Please ensure that your peeringDB entry is up to date with accurate peering limits.

* We don't peer with just IPV4. IPV6 peering is required. We will do just IPV6 peering.

* Don't point a default route at us, and we don't point one towards you.
